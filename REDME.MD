# PWA Camera
A PWA Camera is a web-based camera application that works within a web browser and allows users to capture and store photos and videos directly to their device or to the cloud. The camera feature is an important part of many Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and is used to capture still images or videos and send them to other users or services. It can also be used to capture images and videos for use in the app itself. The camera feature is typically accessed via a button in the appâ€™s user interface and can include settings for taking photos and videos, such as resolution, image quality, frame rate, and more. The camera feature can also be used for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences in a PWA.
